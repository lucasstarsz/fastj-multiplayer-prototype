# Multiplayer Library

Prototype multiplayer library for the [FastJ Game Engine](https://github.com/fastjengine/Fastj).

## Features

- Simple TCP connection and data transmission
- Clientside/Serverside event system
- Support for encrypted communication (up to) TLSv1.3

A reasonably functional "snowball" game is included. (I also don't take legal responsibility if you decide to use the hard-coded passwords on the server or client side.)
